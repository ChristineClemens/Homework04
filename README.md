Christine Clemens - Fourth Homework Submission for SCS Boot Coding Bootcamp

### Objective:
   The aim of this assignment was to code a quiz web application from scratch using what had been learned previously in class.

### For this assignment, I was required to:
* Ensure that the user is prompted to begin the quiz.
* Code a timer that would start counting down when the quiz is prompted to start.
* Subtract time from the clock when a question is answered incorrectly.
* Add time from the clock when a question is answered correctly.
* Code button options that when pressed, prompt the next question to display.
* Alert the user as to whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
* Display the results of the quiz at the end of the quiz.
* Prompt the user to input their name.
* Save the name in local storage and create a high score display.

### I was also encouraged to:
* Create a reset button.

*Unfortunately, although I did include code that was intended to perform the action of storing prompt input to local storage, I was not able to successfully execute the action. Likewise, I struggled with switching between "screens" and therefore, tended to rely on alert boxes which is not what I was hoping to do.
